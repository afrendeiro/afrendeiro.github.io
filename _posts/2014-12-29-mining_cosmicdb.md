I'm interested in proteins that have an "epigenetic" function and want to have a feeling of how is the distribution of their mutations in cancers.

COSMIC (Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer database) allows. 
Since they require login to access the data, I downloaded the data manually on the website. These data are (or were at some point) available through BioMart but I haven't been able to access it programatically and apparently [I'm not the only one](https://www.biostars.org/p/102234/). 

Data will be explored further in the future.
