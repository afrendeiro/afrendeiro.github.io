I needed the location of nucleosomal dyads in the K562 cell line (ENCODE tier 1 line). Surprisingly, although plenty of MNase-seq data exists, no nucleosome and dyad prediction exists.

### NuMap
I found the [NuMap](http://www-hsc.usc.edu/~valouev/NuMap/NuMap.html) software by Anton Valouev to do exactly what I intended.

Since it is in a somewhat obscure page and this seemed to be the only place where this software was, I have [uploaded it into a Github repository](https://github.com/afrendeiro/NuMap) for the sake of preservation.

Predicting dyads from MNase-seq data with NuMap seemed trivial: I downloaded the [K562 MNase-seq data set](http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/encodeDCC/wgEncodeSydhNsome/) (11 replicates ~85Gb!!), combined all replicates and ran NuMap on the data(instructions on the Github README).

From NuMap output there are [dyad positions in bed format](/data/K562_dyads.bed) and you can also produce several metrics to evaluate how good the prediction was.

### Distograms & phasograms

Valouev describes two measurements of the frequencies of distances between MNase-seq reads. The frequency of distances between reads mapping to opposite strands can be used to build a "distogram", which ilustrates the expected nucleosome length (147 bp) - this is consistent across most eukaryotic cells. The frequency of distances between reads mapping to the same strand gives a measurement of the distance between nucleosomes, as they're separated by some linker DNA - (Valouev calls this plot a "phasogram"). This measurement, on the other hand tends to be species and cell-type specific.
