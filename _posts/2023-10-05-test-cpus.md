[Since we've been testing GPUs](/2023/10/04/test-gpus), for the sake of completeness, here's how one can make all the CPU power in a machine go to work. 

Brrrr...

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

"""
Test using all CPUs with parmap.
"""

import parmap


def do(n):
    i = 0
    for i in range(n):
        n += 1


parmap.map(do, [1000000000] * 1000, pm_processes=28)
```
