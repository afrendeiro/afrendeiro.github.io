<p>This website was initially intended to be an <a href='http://andre-rendeiro.me/2014/10/29/notebook'>open electronic lab notebook</a>. However, due to restrictions on sharing unpublished data I am not allowed to use it strictly as such. I now post abstract methods and approaches that I develop for my work.</p>
